# Publican

ðŸ§” The package that will help you out with Dart's Pub ðŸŽ¯

## Getting started

Bring **publican** to your global dependencies:

```shell
pub global activate publican
```

Create a new folder, enter it and start a `pubspec.yaml` file:

```shell
mkdir my_awesome_app
cd  my_awesome_app
publican init
```

It will generate a `pubspec.yaml` file with the following defaults:

```yaml
name: my_app
version: 0.1.0
description: My awesome Dart app
```

_Note: it will not override your current pubspec.yaml file, if you already have one, its safe._
